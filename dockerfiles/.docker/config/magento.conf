## Example configuration:
 upstream fastcgi_backend {
     server unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;
 }
 server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    #server_name local.sssports.com;
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ @handler;
                expires 30d;
        }
    location @handler {
        rewrite / /index.php;
    }

    location ~ .php/ {
        rewrite ^(.*.php)/ $1 last;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        #
        #       # With php7.0-cgi alone:
        #       fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        #       # With php7.0-fpm:
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;
        }
}
#
    ## Optional override of deployment mode. We recommend you use the
    ## command 'bin/magento deploy:mode:set' to switch modes instead.
    ##
    ## set $MAGE_MODE default; # or production or developer
    ##
    ## If you set MAGE_MODE in server config, you must pass the variable into the
    ## PHP entry point blocks, which are indicated below. You can pass
    ## it in using:
    ##
    ## fastcgi_param  MAGE_MODE $MAGE_MODE;
    ##
    ## In production mode, you should uncomment the 'expires' directive in the /static/ location block
